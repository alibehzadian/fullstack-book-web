# Introduction to Java Programming language

> "Java is a very general-purpose language. Itâ€™s designed to span many different domains. You can write server-side programs; you can write apps for mobile phones; you can write scientific programs; you can write software that travels between planets."
>
> <cite>James Gosling, Founder and lead designer of the Java programming language</cite>


In 1991, a project called "Green" was started in Sun Microsystems. The goal of this project was to create a programming language that can run on all hardware. This goal was a very big goal. This project was called "Java" at the end of the work. When Java was being developed, C and C++ dominated other programming languages. However, their major weaknesses plague many programmers. For example, if you wanted to write a program in C language and run it on computers made by different companies, you would have to compile its source code in each of the machines and run the executable code in the desired machine. So far, the problem was not very difficult, but the point was that you had to change the source code every time to compile the program. In addition, you had to always maintain several different versions of the source code, which greatly increased the cost of software production.

In 1995, the first version of Java language was introduced to the world along with a shocking technology called Applet. The new language claimed to work on all existing operating systems. You don't need to create and maintain different source codes for your application. The motto of the new language was "Write Once, Run Anywhere". A new language had come to shape the future of the web. The new language gave everyone hope. It did not have the major drawbacks of previous languages such as C and C++, and therefore it was welcomed by programmers all over the world.

This language followed its natural course and changes were made according to the opinions of the programmers. However, Java strongly believed in adhering to its motto and was able to defend its claim with authority. In 1999, Sun divided the Java language into three main branches:

* Java 2 Standard Version or J2SE: This branch contains all the standard features of the Java language.
* Java 2 Enterprise Edition or J2EE: This branch is for server-side programming.
* Java 2 micro version or J2ME: This branch is for programming consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones.

The natural growth of Java continued and every now and then new versions and modifications of Java were introduced to the programming community. 

In 2005 Sun decided to change its naming convention. The name of the Java language along with its version number would be something like j2sdk_1.4.06. After this year and due to the many changes made in the Java language, this language chose the name Java 5.

The three main branches of the Java language were also renamed while maintaining the previous goals and features. The new names for each are as follows: Java SE or Java Standard Edition, Java EE or Java Enterprise Edition and Java ME or Java Micro Edition.

Since that year Oracle has presented a new version of Java language every year. Currently, the latest long term supported (LTS) version of Java is Java 17. 

# Java, JDK, JRE and JVM

# Install Java

## About Java Versions

# First Java Application
It is time for a cup of "Java"! We already have installed Java. We don't want to use any IDE for our first Java program! So, Open your preferred text editor (For example Notepad in windows) and write this code (please, do not copy for this time!):

```java
public class FisrtCupApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("My first cup of Java!");
    }
}
```

Save the file with `FisrtCupApp.java`. 

Warning: The file name must be as the same as clss name. It is case-sensitive and, for example `FisrtCupApp.java` is different with `FisrtcupApp.java` and the second one won't compile.

Now, it is time to compile our Java program. Open your terminal (in windows, open `Command Prompt`), change directory to the `FisrtCupApp.java` directory and then run this command:

```
javac FisrtCupApp.java
```

After successfull compile, you will see a new generated file: `FisrtCupApp.class`. This is compiled version of our app that we can run it on every machine with Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.

To run the program, run this command in the terminal:

```
java FisrtCupApp
```

If everything goes well, you can see a message in your terminal:

```
My first cup of Java!
```

This program includes one `class`. Classes are the main building block of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). 

In this class, there is a method called main(). This method is the starting point of all Java programs. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes this method to start a Java program, and as soon as this method is finished, the execution of the program ends. 

Inside this method there is a statement. Running this line will show `My first cup of Java!` in the output window.

# Java Class Structure

# Java Data Types

In any program we deal with a number of values. The program may work with numbers, or with characters. For example, suppose we want to take two different numbers from the input in a program, perform mathematical operations on them, and print the result in the output. We call this program `SimpleCalculator`:

```java
/**
 * A very simple calculator.
 */
public class SimpleCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}
```

Now we need to change the program so that it can store two numbers with different names and values:

```java
/**
 * A very simple calculator.
 */
public class SimpleCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int first;
        int second;        
    }
}
```
Now our `main()` method has two variables called `first` and `second`. In programming terms, `first` and `second` are called `variables`. 

As you have seen so far, each variable contains a name and a type. In the `SimpleCalculator` example, we have two variables named `first` and `second`, both of which are `int` type. 

Each variable has a value in addition to name and type. Now we want to modify the `SimpleCalculator` class so that we can initialize our variables:


```java
/**
 * A very simple calculator.
 */
import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class SimpleCalculator {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int first;
        int second;
 
        Scanner input = new Scanner( System.in );
 
        System.out.print("Enter first integer: ");
        first = input.nextInt();
 
        System.out.print("Enter second integer: ");
        second = input.nextInt();
    }
}
```

For now, we have nothing to do with the `Scanner` class. Just know that we use the methods of this class to read the inputs of the program. 

After running the above program, the phrase `Enter first integer:` is displayed in the output console and you can enter the desired value in front of it. Then the next line will be displayed with the phrase `Enter second integer:` where you can enter the value you want for the second variable. 

Now we perform some mathematical operations on these two numbers and print the result in the output:


```java
/**
 * A very simple calculator.
 */
import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class SimpleCalculator {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int first;
        int second;
 
        Scanner input = new Scanner( System.in );
 
        System.out.print("Enter first integer: ");
        first = input.nextInt();
 
        System.out.print("Enter second integer: ");
        second = input.nextInt();
 
        System.out.println("first + second = " + ( first + second ) );
        System.out.println("first - second = " + ( first - second ) );
        System.out.println("first * second = " + ( first * second ) );
        System.out.println("first / second = " + ( first / second ) );
    }
}
```

The purpose of any computer program is to process data. For this, any program must be able to input data, process it, and display the result appropriately. 

To process data in the program, we need to be able to identify the data. We need to know what kind they are. We also need to know how much each of them has at any given moment. 

As you saw in the previous program, we assign three attributes to each variable: type, name and value. The general pattern of variable definition (also called declaration) in Java language is as follows:

```java
Type name;
```

After defining a variable, we must be able to assign a value to it. For this, we use the following pattern:

```java
name = Value;
```

If we want, we can do two steps of defining the variable and assigning a value to it in one command:

```java
Type name = Value;
```

Now some examples of declaring variables and assigning values to them:

```java
int a = 5;                   // An integer variable with value 5
char someChar = 'A';         // A character variable with value 'A'
double PI = 3.14;            // A floating point number with value 3.14 
String hello = "Hello Java"; // A String with value "Hello Java"
```

## Java Primitives
After getting acquainted with variables and how to define and value them, we can see the complete list of Java primitive data types:

| Syntax      | Range of allowed values                          | Description  |
| ----------- | -----------------------                          | ------------ |
| boolean     | `true` and `false`                               | Suitable for logical variables that always have one of two values, true or false |
| char        | From Unicode's zero to 2<sup>16</sup>-1 unicode  | Suitable for all types of literal variables. Considering that letter variables in Java Unicode are 16-bit, they can be used for all letters of all languages.|
| byte        | From -128 to 127                                 | Suitable for integer variables that are within the limit of allowed integer values. |
| short       | From -2<sup>-15</sup> to 2<sup>15</sup>-1        | Suitable for integer variables that are within the limit of allowed integer values (around -32,000 to +32,000).|
| int         | From -2<sup>-31</sup> to 2<sup>31</sup>-1        | Suitable for integer variables that are within the limit of allowed integer values (around -2,000,000,000 to +2,000,000,000).|
| long        | From -2<sup>-63</sup> to 2<sup>63</sup>-1        | Suitable for very, very large integer variables! |
| float       | IEEE754 (approx 3.4E38- to 3.4E38 with 8 digits of decimal precision)         | Suitable for floating point numbers with good precision for routine calculations |
| double      | IEEE754 (Approximately from 1.8E308-up to 1.8E308 with 16 digits decimal precision)   | Suitable for very high precision floating point numbers for double precision calculations |
| void        | No-Value        | For variables that have no type (we'll talk more about the `void` type later) |

## Java Wrapper classes for Primitive Types

## Literal Varialbles

In some Java programs you may want to use values directly. Consider the following statement:

```java
int a = 5;
```
In the above example, the number 5 is a literal variable. The Java compiler has some rules for literals. For example, it recognizes correct literal variables like the above example by default of `int` type. Now, if you want to assign the number 5 to a long variable in an assignment command using the = operator, you must do the following:

```java
long a = 5L;
```
The letter `L` immediately after the number 5 tells the Java compiler that the literal variable 5 is of `long` type. Also, the default for floating point literals in Java is of `double` type. Consider the following line of code:

```java
float a = 3.14;
```
Do you think this line code will compile? Try it! As you may have guessed and probably tested your guess, the Java compiler throws an error when executing the above code:

```
possible loss of precision
found:    double
required: float
float a = 3.14;
          ^
1 error
```
Did you get the cause of the error? The literal variable 3.14 is assumed by the Java compiler to be `double` by default. When it wants to put its value in a floating point variable of type `float`, the precision of the `double` must be reduced to `float`, and this is an error from the Java compiler's point of view. 

To solve this problem, you must explicitly tell the Java compiler that 3.14 is a `float` literal. For this, we do the same as the following command:

```java
float a = 3.14F;
```
The letter `F` immediately after 3.14 forces the Java compiler to consider the literal variable 3.14 to be of `float` type.
