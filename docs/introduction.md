# Introduction

You have an idea about a new software and you want to implement it, but you don't know how to start, which technologies to use, how to build and run that software and more importantly, how to keep it running? You are not alone! Even experienced developers, when want to start new project have the same questions, more or less. That's because of the very fast evolving nature of software development technologies.

If you search internet for am answer, you get more confused! Each technology has its own pros and cons, fans or haters! Windows or Linux? Java or ".NET"? React or Vue? MySQL or MariaDB? Flutter or React Native? The endless debates! It is like walking in a dark jungle without a map and torch!

There are many documents, tutorials, blogs and youtube channels that teach you about a particular topic at various levels, from beginner to advanced, and there are many other resources that teach you about several seemingly separate topics, each of which is part of a larger prespective. But you have to connect these dots yourself.

What's much less common are resources that give you a road map. They tell you that if you want to reach your destination, you must use these routes, and they give you the necessary guidance in each part of the route.  

Here I want to help you to start a journey! I want to provide you all the necessary tools to start developing a software and running it in the internet to server other peoples. You will learn how to deal with the design concepts, backend code, websites and dashboards and mobile apps! It is a long adventurous journey!

To do so, I will make a software, a very commercial one, not just a sample TODO app, and share all the steps I take with you, in details. I believe that this way you will see the real challenges of developing a full-featured commercial software. 

TODO: Talk about importance of having overview of all aspects of software development 

TODO: Talk about V-shape and T-shape developers

TODO: Talk about definition of a fullstack developer

TODO: Talk about purpose of this book

TODO: Talk about roadmap

TODO: Ask for comment, review and support (donation)!
