# Introduction

You have an idea about a new software and you want to implement it, but you don't know how to start, which technologies to use, how to build and run that software and more importantly, how to keep it running? You are not alone! Even experienced developers, when want to start new project have the same questions, more or less. That's because of the very fast evolving nature of software development technologies.

If you search the internet for an answer, you get more confused! Each technology has its own pros and cons, fans or haters! Windows or Linux? Java or .NET? React or Vue? MySQL or MariaDB? Flutter or React Native? These debates seem never-ending! It is like walking in a dark jungle without a map and torch!

There are many documents, tutorials, blogs and youtube channels that teach you about a particular topic at various levels, from beginner to advanced, and there are many other resources that teach you about several seemingly separate topics, each of which is part of a larger prespective. However, connecting the dots between these resources can be challenging.

What's much less common are resources that give you a road map. They tell you that if you want to reach your destination, you must use these routes, and they give you the necessary guidance in each part of the route.  

Here, I want to help you start a journey! I want to provide you with all the necessary tools to start developing a software and running it in the internet to serve other peoples. You will learn how to deal with the design concepts, backend code, websites and dashboards and mobile apps! It is a long and adventurous journey!

To do so, I will make a software, a very commercial one, not just a sample TODO app, and share all the steps I take with you, in details. I believe that this way you will see the real challenges of developing a full-featured commercial software.

# Fullstack Developer

When you develop a software, you have at least two sides: server side and client side. The server side is the side that only developers can see and touch. And the client side that final users can see and touch. The terms server-side and client-side evolved these days and now they are "Backend" and "Frontend". Fullstack developers are technical people that can develop for both backend and frontend. 

The challenges, skills needed and technologies used for backend and frontend are different. If you want to be a fullstack developer, you need to prepare for two different categories of technical issues and challenges and constantly context switching between two different worlds. 

It seems that it is not easy to be a fullstack developer! But there are lots of benefits for being a fullstack developer. For me, the best thing about being a fullstack developer is that you have a basic understanding of how everything works! You know about the servers, databases, APIs, web and mobile development. So, you can start developing your ideas with no -or very low- cost. If you work as a fullstack developer with a software development team, you can help all teammates, you can help the company to reduct its costs and development time. You have the chance to learn new technologies and test all of them before others.  

# The Product 

I have an idea! I think that it has a very good market and I want to start building it. The idea is about building a software to help companies and their emplyees manage hybrid working. After COVID-19 pandemic, many companies around the world were forced to try a new way of working remotely. There were many problems for the companies that they did not have a solution for. Nearly three years into the pandemic, it seems many companies and workforces are choosing to use the lessons learned during that time and implement smart hybrid working practices. Naturally, startups were created to respond to these needs, and a complete and definitive solution has not yet been created for it. I also want to create a system for managing mixed work based on my experiences, and of course I will share the work steps with you in detail.

I assume that you know programming languages I will use during this project. But, don't worry if you don't know them. I will write a crash course for each of them in the "prerequisite" section of this website. 

We start by preparing our environment. Then create a backend application using "Spring Boot" framework. A dahboard for users using "React" and "iOS" and "Android" mobile applications using "Flutter" framework. 

We deploy the whole application on "Amazon web Services" or "AWS". We will also try to cover deployment on "Microsoft Azure" and "Google Cloud" too.

# Support

You can help me during this project by fixing my typos and error codes, improving code quality, or maybe help me to write some sections of the book. At the end, if you like this project and want to buy me a coffee, see details in [Support]({% link docs/support.md %}) page.
